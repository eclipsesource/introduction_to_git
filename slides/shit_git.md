Git can be hard sometimes, and with teams you may find your repository in an
inconsistent state. However, **almost** everything can be recovered.

Git is really just a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of commits, and most git
commands simply modify that graph. If you get into trouble, you can usually
re-modify the graph as you need.

Oh shit, Git! has solutions to several common problems:
* Oh shit, I did something terribly wrong, please tell me git has a magic time machine!?!
* Oh shit, I committed and immediately realized I need to make one small change!
* Oh shit, I need to change the message on my last commit!
* Oh shit, I accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch!
* Oh shit, I accidentally committed to the wrong branch!
* Oh shit, I tried to run a diff but nothing happened?!
