Create a new repository for your project, or fork an existing repository.

A **fork** is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on
your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without
affecting the original.

**Pull requests** are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a
user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.

**Pushing** refers to sending your committed changes to a remote
repository such as GitHub.com.

With GitHub you will each have a _fork_ of your repository. Designate one
as the **master**. You can work together or individually on some feature.
When you are ready, you can _push_ your feature to your repository and
issue a _pull request_ to synchronize with the master repository.

Use **GitHub Issues** to track work items. Create issues for the work you need
to do, and assign them to members of your group.
* Start a discussion about the work item
* Use `@mention` to directly reach another member of your team
* Link to commit IDs directly from the conversation
* Use commit messages with syntax such as `fixes #123` to automatically close issues
