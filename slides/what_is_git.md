Have you ever done the following:
* `essay.txt`
* `essay-reviewed.txt`
* `essay-final.txt`
* `essay-final-2.txt`
* `essay-final-midnight.txt`

Git is a **version control system** so you can manage the different
revisions of a set of files.

Git is *distributed*, so several people can work simultaneously on the same
project.
